medusa
======

In Greek mythology Medusa was a monster, a Gorgon, generally described as having the face of a hideous human female with living venomous snakes in place of hair. Gazing directly upon her would turn onlookers to stone. Most sources describe her as the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto.

In modern software development, Medusa, a Gem, is generally described as the most beautiful parallel build system, evar. Running directly upon your servers will turn slow CI cycles to ash. Most sources describe her as the impossible daughter of Hydra, testbot, and test-queue (who says multiple inheritance is bad?).
