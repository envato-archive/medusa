module Medusa #:nodoc:
  # Read and write between two processes via pipes. For example:
  #   @pipe = Medusa::Pipe.new
  #   @child = Process.fork do
  #     @pipe.identify_as_child
  #     puts "A message from my parent:\n#{@pipe.gets.text}"
  #     @pipe.close
  #   end
  #   @pipe.identify_as_parent
  #   @pipe.write Medusa::Messages::TestMessage.new(:text => "Hello!")
  #   @pipe.close
  #
  # Note that the TestMessage class is only available in tests, and
  # not in Medusa by default.
  #
  #
  # When the process forks, the pipe is copied. When a pipe is
  # identified as a parent or child, it is choosing which ends
  # of the pipe to use.
  #
  # A pipe is actually two pipes:
  #
  #  Parent  == Pipe 1 ==> Child
  #  Parent <== Pipe 2 ==  Child
  #
  # It's like if you had two cardboard tubes and you were using
  # them to drop balls with messages in them between processes.
  # One tube is for sending from parent to child, and the other
  # tube is for sending from child to parent.
